Are you looking for a way to host your Laravel site statically on Netlify using the tools you're already comfortable with?

Well, look no further. Thanks to the amazing team of [Spatie](https://spatie.be/) this is now very much a thing – with minimal setup you'll be up and running in no time using one of their latest packages called [Laravel Export](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-export).

Let me show you how.

***

## Getting started

Let's assume we have a fresh installation of Laravel including a few basic routes, initialized and pushed our codebase to a GitHub repository and connected the repository with Netlify.

Get the party started by adding `spatie/laravel-export` to your project via composer:

``` bash
# @ path/to/your/project
$ composer require spatie/laravel-export

# Optionally publish the config file
$ php artisan vendor:publish
```

Next, let's generate the static bundle of our site using the export command to make sure everything is working as expected, you should see something like this:

``` bash
$ php artisan export
Starting export...
Files were saved to disk `export`
```

By default, Laravel Export will save the static bundle in a `dist/` folder in your application root. More in-depth information regarding the configuration is available in the [documentation](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-export#configuration).

Before we push our changes to git, let's add our entire site bundle to `.gitignore` and generate the static files on the server instead using a `netlify.toml` file placed in our application root:

``` bash
# .gitignore
dist/
```

``` nginx
# netlify.toml
[build]

command = "php artisan export"
publish = "dist/"

[build.environment]

PHP_VERSION = "7.2"
```

**☝🏻Make sure you use the same publish path as you've configured in Laravel Export, in this case it's `dist/` as we didn't make any configuration changes.**

Okay, easy. Right? Lastly, we need to configure some `.env` variables before we build and publish our site. Let's head over to the Netlify dashboard:

Go to **_Site settings_** > **_Build & deploy_** > **_Build environment variables_** > **_Edit variables_**, add the following and hit save:

``` env
APP_DEBUG=true
APP_ENV=production
APP_KEY=YOUR_LARAVEL_APP_KEY
APP_NAME=Your site name
APP_URL=https://yoursite.com/
```

Voila! You're done 🎉. Now trigger a new deploy within Netlify and go visit your site url. How cool is that, eh?

***

## Important note

As described in the [documentation](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-export#determining-the-export-contents), it's important to link pages within your app properly in order for them to be included in the export. You can specify an array of URL's that will be recursively crawled and exported to HTML if needed.

## 🔥 Hawt tip

Going with this approach for your static site, I would highly recommend adding the `spatie/sheets` package for some extra flavor. This enables you to store and retrieve content _(such as pages, blog posts etc)_ using markdown and front matter. Awesome!

One of the major benefits of this is that we now have **_our entire site in version control_**, eliminating the need for a database entirely.

In fact, this very website is running on Laravel statically using [Sheets](https://github.com/spatie/sheets/) and [Laravel Export](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-export), and is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Full source code is open source and available over at [GitHub](https://github.com/robbinworks/site).
